# FinTrack
FinTrack is a personal finance management application developed as part of the Mentor the Young program in Serbia, with the support of a mentor.

The goal of this project is to create a functional application that will allow users to track income, expenses, and categorize transactions. The development is planned over three months, with a focus on setting up the basic architecture, implementing security (JWT authentication), CRUD operations for transactions, and integrating the database using Entity Framework Core and MySQL. Throughout this process, the application will evolve into a tool for organizing and optimizing personal finances.
